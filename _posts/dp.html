<p><strong>Subtitle:</strong> How Privacy-Preserving Learning Works Behind the Scenes</p>

<p>Imagine training an AI model on millions of personal medical records.  
We want the model to learn general patterns — not memorize individuals.  
That’s exactly what <em>Deep Learning with Differential Privacy</em> achieves.</p>

<h2>1. The Problem: When AI Remembers Too Much</h2>
<p>Traditional models can accidentally “leak” private data.  
For example, a language model might memorize a phone number or name  
from its training set. That’s where differential privacy comes in.</p>

<h2>2. How DP-SGD Works</h2>
<p>DP-SGD makes small but critical changes to the training process:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Gradient clipping:</strong> Limits how much influence any single example can have.</li>
  <li><strong>Noise addition:</strong> Adds Gaussian noise to gradients to hide individuals’ effects.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy accounting:</strong> Tracks the total privacy budget (ε, δ) over iterations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. The Impact</h2>
<p>This 2016 work by Abadi et al. showed that deep models could be trained privately 
without losing much accuracy — a milestone for modern AI ethics and security.</p>

<h2>4. Takeaway</h2>
<p>In short, <em>teaching AI to whisper</em> means giving it just enough voice 
to learn patterns, but not enough to reveal secrets.</p>
