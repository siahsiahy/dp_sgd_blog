I'm an undergraduate student at **Yonsei University**, majoring in **Computer Science**.  
My research interests include **XR interaction**, **lightweight AI agents**, **Deep Learning**, and **Differential Privacy**.  

I’m currently working on:
- Gaze-based interaction systems for XR environments  
- Efficient reasoning agents using **TinyLLaMA**  

Outside of research, I enjoy designing VR/AR prototypes and exploring human–AI interaction.

You can find my projects and blog posts [here](/blog/),  
or connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/siashiahy).
