<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2> <p>Deep learning showed me how models can learn powerful patterns from massive amounts of data.<br> But data privacy reminded me that these datasets often come from <strong>real people</strong> — each record a small fragment of someone’s life.</p> <p>That made me wonder:<br> <em>Can we build models that learn, without exposing the people who taught them?</em></p> <p>This question led me to explore <strong>DP-SGD (Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent)</strong> —<br> an elegant training method that allows neural networks to <strong>learn responsibly</strong> —<br> keeping the insights, but forgetting the identities.</p> <hr> <p>Just like how attention helps models focus on <strong>important regions</strong> in an image,<br> differential privacy helps models <strong>forget unnecessary details</strong> about individual samples.<br> Take the two brains in Fig. 1 as an example.</p> <p><img src="assets/img/dpsgd_brain.png" alt="Illustration of DP-SGD vs SGD"></p> <p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A visual comparison between <strong>SGD</strong> and <strong>DP-SGD</strong>.<br> The brain on the left (SGD) memorizes every tiny detail — faces, words, and data points — while the brain on the right (DP-SGD) only retains the general patterns after adding noise.<br> This simple idea makes models <em>learn like humans — remembering what matters, and forgetting what doesn’t.</em></p> <hr> <h2 id="why-whisper">Why Whisper?</h2> <p><em>Why should a neural network learn to whisper instead of shout?</em></p> <p>Modern deep learning thrives on <strong>data — lots of it.</strong><br> The more data a model sees, the smarter it becomes.<br> But there’s a catch: much of that data is <strong>personal</strong> — medical records, voice recordings, photos, chat logs.</p> <blockquote> <p>“The more a model learns, the more it remembers.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Imagine training a speech recognition system.<br> It might not only learn to recognize words,<br> but also <strong>remember the speaker’s voice</strong> so well<br> that someone could later reconstruct what that person said.<br> That’s not intelligence — that’s a privacy leak.</p> <h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3> <p>Deep neural networks have millions (or even billions) of parameters.<br> These parameters don’t just learn <em>patterns</em> — they can memorize <em>examples</em>.<br> Even without malicious intent, attackers can exploit this fact.</p> <p>Researchers have shown <strong>model inversion attacks</strong>,<br> where adversaries, given access to a model’s outputs,<br> can reconstruct sensitive parts of the training data —<br> like recreating someone’s face from a classifier’s memory.</p> <p>In short:</p> <blockquote> <p>The bigger and more capable our models become,<br> the more they risk revealing what they were trained on.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="the-goal">The Goal</h3> <p>The main goal of this paper is to train deep learning models that can <strong>learn from data without revealing anyone’s secrets</strong>.</p> <p>The authors introduced <strong>DP-SGD</strong>, a clever twist on the classic SGD algorithm.<br> It adds a bit of random noise during training, so the model learns general patterns — but forgets the fine details about any individual.</p> <p>That is to say, they wanted to prove that <strong>privacy and performance don’t have to be enemies</strong> —<br> you can build smart models and keep people’s data safe at the same time.</p> <hr> <h2 id="what-does-dp-sgd-actually-do">What Does DP-SGD Actually Do?</h2> <p>In deep learning, we usually train models with <strong>stochastic gradient descent (SGD)</strong>, letting them adjust their weights based on every tiny detail in the data.<br> That’s great for accuracy — but sometimes the model <em>remembers too much</em>, even bits of someone’s private information.</p> <p>That’s where <strong>DP-SGD</strong> (Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent) steps in.<br> It takes the same learning process and adds a bit of mathematical “privacy dust.”</p> <hr> <h3 id="the-math-behind-the-privacy">The Math Behind the Privacy</h3> <p>Under the hood, DP-SGD relies on the formal definition of <strong>differential privacy</strong>.<br> A randomized mechanism ( \mathcal{M} : \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{R} ) is said to satisfy<br> ( (\varepsilon, \delta) )-differential privacy if, for any two adjacent datasets ( d, d’ \in \mathcal{D} ) and any subset of outputs ( S \subseteq \mathcal{R} ),</p> <p>[ \Pr[\mathcal{M}(d) \in S] \le e^{\varepsilon} \Pr[\mathcal{M}(d’) \in S] + \delta ]</p> <p>This means that whether or not your data is included, the algorithm’s behavior doesn’t change much —<br> no single individual can drastically affect the outcome.</p> <hr> <h3 id="the-gaussian-mechanism">The Gaussian Mechanism</h3> <p>To achieve this, DP uses noise drawn from a Gaussian distribution:</p> <p>[ \mathcal{M}(d) \triangleq f(d) + \mathcal{N}(0, S_f^2 \cdot \sigma^2) ]</p> <p>where</p> <ul> <li>( S_f ) is the <strong>sensitivity</strong> (the largest possible change in ( f ) when one data point changes), and</li> <li>( \sigma ) controls the noise scale — larger ( \sigma ) means stronger privacy.</li> </ul> <p>DP-SGD effectively applies this mechanism at every training step, ensuring that each gradient update respects the same privacy guarantee.</p> <hr> <p>So to me, DP-SGD is a way of teaching models to <strong>learn from the crowd, not from individuals</strong>. It keeps the essence of the data, but forgets who said what — which feels like a much more human way to learn.</p> <hr> <h2 id="algorithm-making-sgd-private">Algorithm: Making SGD Private</h2> <p>Algorithm 1 outlines our basic method for training a model with parameters (\theta) by minimizing the empirical loss function (\mathcal{L}(\theta)).<br> At each step of SGD, we compute the gradient (\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta, x_i)) for a random subset of examples, clip the ℓ₂ norm of each gradient, compute the average, add Gaussian noise to protect privacy, and take a step in the opposite direction of this average noisy gradient.<br> At the end of training, we output the final model (\theta_T) and compute the overall privacy cost ((\varepsilon, \delta)) using a privacy accountant.</p> <hr> <h3 id="algorithm-1-differentially-private-sgd-outline"><strong>Algorithm 1: Differentially Private SGD (Outline)</strong></h3> <p><strong>Input:</strong><br> Examples ({x_1, \dots, x_N}), loss function<br> [ \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \mathcal{L}(\theta, x_i) ]<br> Parameters: learning rate (\eta_t), noise scale (\sigma), group size (L), gradient norm bound (C).</p> <p><strong>Initialize</strong> (\theta_0) randomly</p> <p><strong>for</strong> (t \in [T]) <strong>do</strong><br>     Take a random sample (L_t) with sampling probability (L/N)<br>     <strong>Compute gradient:</strong><br> [ g_t(x_i) \leftarrow \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta_t, x_i) ]</p> <p>    <strong>Clip gradient:</strong><br> [ \bar{g}_t(x_i) \leftarrow g_t(x_i) / \max\Big(1, \frac{||g_t(x_i)||_2}{C}\Big) ]</p> <p>    <strong>Add noise:</strong><br> [ \tilde{g}_t \leftarrow \frac{1}{L} \Big(\sum_i \bar{g}_t(x_i) + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 C^2 \mathbf{I})\Big) ]</p> <p>    <strong>Descent:</strong><br> [ \theta_{t+1} \leftarrow \theta_t - \eta_t \tilde{g}_t ]</p> <p><strong>Output:</strong> (\theta_T) and compute the overall privacy cost ((\varepsilon, \delta)) using a privacy accounting method.</p> <hr> <h3 id="the-moments-accountant-keeping-track-of-privacy">The Moments Accountant: Keeping Track of Privacy</h3> <p>The <strong>Moments Accountant</strong> keeps a tight bound on how much privacy loss has accumulated during training.<br> It’s based on the idea that every noisy gradient update “spends” a small privacy cost —<br> and this accountant tracks those costs precisely over all steps.</p> <p>The accountant defines a <em>privacy loss random variable</em> that compares how likely a given output is when training on two adjacent datasets (differing by one person’s data):</p> <p>[ c(o; \mathcal{M}, d, d’) = \log \frac{\Pr[\mathcal{M}(d) = o]}{\Pr[\mathcal{M}(d’) = o]} ]</p> <p>This measures how much the inclusion or exclusion of one example can influence the output.<br> We then compute the <strong>log moments</strong> of this variable:</p> <p>[ \alpha_{\mathcal{M}}(\lambda; d, d’) = \log \mathbb{E}_{o \sim \mathcal{M}(d)} [\exp(\lambda c(o; \mathcal{M}, d, d’))] ]</p> <p>and take the maximum over all possible pairs of neighboring datasets.<br> These moments can then be converted into an overall privacy guarantee ((\varepsilon, \delta)).</p> <p>In short, the Moments Accountant works like a <strong>ledger</strong> — it records exactly how much privacy has been spent,<br> ensuring that the final model doesn’t exceed the allowed budget.</p> <hr> <h3 id="hyperparameter-tuning-balancing-privacy-and-accuracy">Hyperparameter Tuning: Balancing Privacy and Accuracy</h3> <p>In deep learning, tuning <strong>hyperparameters</strong> like batch size, noise level, and learning rate can dramatically affect both accuracy and privacy.<br> Through experiments, the paper finds that model accuracy is more sensitive to these parameters than to network architecture itself.</p> <p>When we try multiple hyperparameter configurations, each run technically adds to the total privacy cost.<br> However, using results from theory (e.g., Gupta et al.), we can control this accumulation and reuse information across runs more efficiently.</p> <p>Empirically, the best settings tend to be:</p> <ul> <li>Small to moderate <strong>batch sizes</strong> — too large a batch increases privacy loss.</li> <li>A relatively <strong>large learning rate</strong> at the beginning, which decays over time.</li> <li>Carefully chosen <strong>noise scale</strong> (\sigma) to balance accuracy and privacy.</li> </ul> <hr> <h3 id="thats-what-i-think">That’s What I Think</h3> <p>To me, this section is where the algorithm becomes “human.”<br> DP-SGD isn’t just about math or bounds — it’s about <em>teaching a model to learn responsibly</em>.<br> The gradient clipping feels like setting social boundaries, and the Gaussian noise is like gentle confusion that protects everyone’s secrets.</p> <p>The Moments Accountant then plays the role of a careful observer, making sure the learning process never crosses the line of privacy.<br> And hyperparameter tuning is where art meets science — finding that sweet spot<br> where the model learns <em>just enough</em> without remembering too much.</p> <p>Here is the lightweight implementation of the code.</p> <hr> <h2 id="implementing-dp-sgd-where-theory-meets-tensorflow">Implementing DP-SGD: Where Theory Meets TensorFlow</h2> <p>We have implemented the differentially private SGD algorithms in Tensor Flow.

Each line in the plot below represents a different (ε, δ) pair:</p> <p>What’s happening here:</p> <ul> <li>Smaller epsilon = stronger privacy = slightly lower accuracy.</li> <li>But even with ε=1 and δ=1e-5, the drop is tolerable.</li> <li>There’s a clear “diminishing returns” zone — cranking up ε too high doesn’t boost accuracy much more.</li> </ul> <hr> <h3 id="what-happens-when-we-tweak-one-hyperparameter">What Happens When We Tweak One Hyperparameter?</h3> <p>To see how robust the model is, we varied each parameter individually — like projection dimension, hidden units, lot size, etc. This gives a sense of which knobs matter most.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Projection Dimension</strong>: Accuracy is best around 60 dimensions (PCA). Too low or no PCA hurts generalization.</li> <li> <strong>Hidden Units</strong>: More units help until about 1000–1200; after that, gains plateau.</li> <li> <strong>Lot Size</strong>: There’s a sweet spot near 600.</li> <li> <strong>Learning Rate</strong>: 0.05 seems optimal — too high and things crash.</li> <li> <strong>Clipping Norm</strong>: Between 4–6 is stable.</li> <li> <strong>Noise Level</strong>: Moderate noise still yields strong results!</li> </ul> <hr> <h3 id="cifar-10-results-what-about-real-images">CIFAR-10 Results: What About Real Images?</h3> <p>MNIST is nice, but what about a more complex dataset like CIFAR-10?

Since the late 90s, researchers have been scratching their heads about how to learn useful stuff from data without leaking personal info. But the ways people have tackled this vary a lot. Depending on what kind of model they’re using, how the learning is done, and how privacy is guaranteed.</p> <h3 id="privacy-guarantees">Privacy Guarantees</h3> <p>Early privacy-preserving methods used Secure Function Evaluation (SFE) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). These split the data between parties and compute the result together while keeping everyone’s input secret. Cool, but not really applicable here—we assume all data is held centrally, and we care about what leaks from the trained model.</p> <p>Another classic idea is k-anonymity, where data is generalized or suppressed (like saying someone was “born in the 90s” instead of giving their birthday). Unfortunately, this breaks down when dealing with high-dimensional data like images.</p> <p>Instead, most recent work—including ours—leans on Differential Privacy (DP). The idea is to inject carefully calibrated noise into the training process so that it’s hard to tell whether any particular person’s data was used. Techniques like the moments accountant and Rényi DP help track how much “privacy budget” we’re spending during training.</p> <h3 id="learning-algorithms-and-training-techniques">Learning Algorithms and Training Techniques</h3> <p>Most DP work tries to solve convex optimization problems—think logistic regression or SVMs—where the math is easier and DP guarantees are cleaner. But training deep neural networks is non-convex and trickier. This paper pushes forward by applying DP-SGD (stochastic gradient descent with differential privacy) to deep models, even if the theory is messier.</p> <h3 id="model-classes">Model Classes</h3> <p>Other researchers have also tackled DP learning:</p> <p><strong>Netflix Prize (McSherry &amp; Mironov):</strong> The first full-stack DP recommender system using Gaussian noise on sufficient statistics. But their problem had cleaner structure than deep learning. <strong>Distributed DP (Shokri &amp; Shmatikov):</strong> Each user trains on their own data and sends noisy gradients to a central server. But privacy loss per parameter can easily exceed thousands—yikes. <strong>Autoencoders (Phan et al.):</strong> Recent work adds DP constraints to the loss functions of autoencoders.</p> <p>Our approach differs by applying end-to-end DP training using standard neural networks and SGD, without assuming any special structure in the data or model.</p> <hr> <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2> <p>We trained deep neural networks <em>with strong privacy guarantees</em>—and guess what? The performance is still pretty solid.</p> <ul> <li>On <strong>MNIST</strong>, our model hit <strong>97%</strong> accuracy.</li> <li>On <strong>CIFAR-10</strong>, we got <strong>73%</strong>—not bad at all considering we’re adding noise!</li> </ul> <p>All of this while ensuring <strong>(ε = 8, δ = 10⁻⁵)</strong> differential privacy. 🎉 We’re using a private version of <strong>stochastic gradient descent (SGD)</strong> that plugs right into <strong>TensorFlow</strong>. So it’s easy to work with and pretty versatile.</p> <h3 id="keypoint">Keypoint</h3> <p>A big part of what made this work is something called the Moments Accountant. Think of it as a super-smart privacy tracker that knows exactly how much of your privacy budget is being used during training. It’s way more accurate than traditional methods, and it gives us tight control over how noisy we need to be.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Privacy doesn’t have to come at the cost of usefulness.</strong> With the right tools (👋 hello, moments accountant) and some clever training tricks, we can get the best of both worlds: solid performance and user privacy.</p> </blockquote> <hr> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <details> <summary>Show References</summary> 1.
